Our tiny but mighty team works hard to deliver the projects and services that allow Python to be the thriving, independent, community-driven language it is today. Some of what the PSF does includes producing PyCon US, hosting the Python Packaging Index (PyPI), awarding grants to Python initiatives worldwide, maintaining critical community infrastructure, and more.
